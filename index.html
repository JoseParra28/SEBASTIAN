            <h2>DUBLIN-BASED PHOTOGRAPHy BY SEBASTIAN</h2>
            <p>SEBASTIAN is an DUBLIN based photographer, cinematographer and art director. His juxtaposition between light and shadow punctuates his signature style. Seba believes photos are metaphors, making the abstract concrete and mystifying the mundane.</p>
            <p>"I use photography solely as a form of artistic expression, focusing on elements like light, lines, space, and texture to intimately capture my subjects." <br> Seba.</p>
